Salamander Trader
===============

Very simple thing here. 

This project uses Factor. A language with many features of Forth and Lisp. 
The idea is to create a very simple system for bitcoin trading. 

Currently the main program acts as a server periodically pulling prices and executing a strategy. The current challenge is in finding a way to allow for on-the-fly changes to the system without interrupting it.
